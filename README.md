Role Distribution takes place before the game starts. After the roles are distributed, night and day become the regular cycle of the game.

Night occurs when the Narrator tells everyone to close their eyes. Certain characters have special abilities that need to be activiated during the night in secret. For example, the werewolves must point to who they want to kill that night while the other roles close their eyes.

Day occurs after the night phase and everyone is awake. The narrator communicates what happend during the last night phase by saying who died, without revealing their role. The group then has a chance to vote someone to die after there is a formal accusastion and after they defend themselves. The group can only vote one person off per day phase.

The game continues with the repetition of night and day phases. 


# Roles
Doctor - Player is woken up by the narrator each night and must choose one person who is still alive to save. That player is immune to a werewolf kill for that night. The doctor may save himself or herself.

Cop - Player is woken up by the narrator each night and must choose one person who is still alive to check. The narrator will confirm or deny whether that player is a werewolf by nodding or shaking their head.

Witch - The witch has the power to save a player and the power to kill a player. He or she can only use each power once per a game. The witch is the last to be woken up by the narrator in the night phase and is told everyone will die by the narrator. The witch then is able to choose whether to save that person or use their kill power to kill someone.

Cub - The Cub is a werewolf character role whose power is activated when he or she dies in any way other than a werewolf kill. The next night the cub dies, the werewolves get to kill 2 players.

TLDR: These are some descriptions of some of the typical roles of this game. More can be found at https://werewolf-the-game.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Roles. To make it more interesting, you may play with Cupid, Masons, and Executioner.

# Role Distribution
Werewolves usually comprise of a third of the whole group, though it depends on the powers / abilities available to the werewolves and how they compare to the powers / abilities of the townspeople. Role distribution usually takes place before the game begins. The app has the capacity to randomize roles and assign the to players inputted by the narrator in the Game Setup page of the Roles Tab. 

# Inspiration
As my friends and I played more and more Werewolf, and as the roles became more and more complex, writing down everyone's roles and the details of what happend each round as the narrater became more and more necessary. So, I decided to undergo the process of making an app for the first time.
